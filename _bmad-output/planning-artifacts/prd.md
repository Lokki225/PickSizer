# Product Requirements Document - PickSizer

**Author:** FranklinOuattara
**Date:** 2026-01-15

## Success Criteria

### User Success

**The "Aha!" Moment: The "Corrected Intent"**
- When AI anticipates brand-specific preferences without explicit instruction
- User transitions from "It's wrong" to "It's learned"
- Example: Designer adjusts crop for negative space, AI applies same logic to next image

**Measuring "Confidence-as-a-Service"**
- **Override Decay Rate**: Trust = Total Exports ÷ Manual Corrections
- **Success Indicator**: Time-to-Export for 50 images drops from 10 minutes to under 60 seconds
- User shifts from "tweaking" to "scanning"

**The "30-Second Acceptance" Flow**
- Upload 10 diverse images → 30 adapted versions in 5 seconds with "Confidence Glows"
- User clicks "Approve All" or "Export for Shopify"
- **Golden Metric**: Closed-tab-rate within 30 seconds of results

### Business Success

**3-Month North Star: Correction Correlation**
- Percentage of users with "Zero Correction" sessions
- Target: 60% of sessions involve 0 manual adjustments by Month 3
- AI successfully internalizes user's "Commander's Intent"

**Enterprise Brand Lock-In: The "DNA Export" Gap**
- Lead Designer sets "Brand Envelope" rules
- 50+ junior designers use them without "Brand Violation" flags
- Switching cost = re-training institutional taste from scratch

### Technical Success

**Defining "Catastrophic Failure"**
- **Structural Failure**: Cropping through faces/eyes, distorting logos, edge slivers
- **Safety Metric**: "Safe Zone" violations count toward <0.1% failure rate
- Aviation model: crashes are Standard Violations, not bugs

**Performance Threshold: The "Interactive Pulse"**
- **Gold Standard**: <300ms for initial "Confidence Preview" (heuristic model)
- **Deep Processing**: <2 seconds for high-fidelity results
- **Psychology**: >3 seconds = "Supervision Mode", <1 second = "Flow Mode"

### Measurable Outcomes

**Opening Scene:** 11:00 PM, Alex facing "pixel tax" - 45 variations of 12 hero images while maintaining brand consistency across 4-6 clients. The pain isn't effort, it's **cognitive erosion** and fear of damaging expert status.

**Rising Action:** 
- Uploads first batch expecting 40 minutes of tweaking
- PickSizer detects "Lifestyle Product shots" and suggests 3 standard crops for Shopify integration
- AI maintains "Brand Safety Margin" around logo without being told

**Climax:** The "Aha!" moment when Alex realizes PickSizer anticipated unspoken preferences - kept logo safe, maintained brand spacing

**Resolution:** Finishes in 4 minutes instead of 40, closes laptop with **zero anxiety**. PickSizer becomes Alex's "Junior Designer who never gets tired."

### Enterprise Journey: Sarah & Marcus - "Institutional Taste"

**Sarah's Journey (Lead Designer/Guardian):**
- Uploads "Calibration Set" of 20 perfect images
- Defines "Flight Envelope": Never crop product label, maintain 10% white space left
- "Publishes" DNA to Marketing Team

**Marcus's Journey (Junior Marketer):**
- Terrified of "breaking brand" and Sarah's scrutiny
- Uploads new campaign photo
- PickSizer inherits Sarah's preferences, shows "98% alignment with Sarah's standards"

- **Shift**: From passive canvas to active participant with memory and authority
- **Innovation**: Transforms user from supervisor to collaborator with AI partner

**2. Silent Learning vs. Explicit Configuration**
- **Challenged Assumption**: Users shouldn't configure taste, they should exercise it
- **Novel Approach**: Taste as repeatable spatial decisions learned through observation
- **Innovation**: Brand DNA calculated from delta between AI suggestion and user adjustment

**3. Aviation-Grade Trust for Creative Tools**
- **Cross-Pollination**: Applying high-stakes industry patterns to creative domain
- **Innovation**: Flight envelope awareness, progressive authority transfer, safety protocols
- **Novelty**: First creative tool with "professional-grade safety systems"

### Market Context & Competitive Landscape

**Current Market**: Canva, Adobe, Figma treat AI as invoked feature
- **User Role**: Supervisor checking every pixel
- **Model**: Manual Task + Algorithmic Suggestion

**PickSizer Disruption**: Governing layer that holds the line
- **User Role**: Collaborator exercising taste, not programming rules
- **Model**: Predictive Professionalism vs. Generative Chaos

### Validation Approach

**The Silent vs. Explicit A/B Test:**
- **Group A (Explicit)**: 10 minutes configuring brand rules before 100 images
- **Group B (PickSizer Silent)**: Immediate processing, manual correction on first 5 images
- **Success Metrics**: Lower Total Time to Export + Higher Satisfaction Score for Group B

**Key Insight**: Users doing their job vs. programming it

### Risk Mitigation

**Mechanical Linkage Fallback:**
- Trust drops → Confidence Glow disappears → Traditional Free-Crop handles appear
- Manual overrides become Training Events, not failures
- Contextual Conflict logging with "New direction vs. one-time exception" clarification

## Web Application Specific Requirements

### Project-Type Overview

PickSizer is a Single Page Application (SPA) with "Heavy Client" philosophy, designed for continuous "Flow State" user journey (Upload → Adapt → Export). The architecture prioritizes client-side processing using WebAssembly for performance-critical image operations while maintaining real-time collaboration features through WebSockets.

- **Flow State**: Continuous user experience without page reloads to maintain "Silent Assistant" presence
- **Client-First**: Heavy processing in browser using WebAssembly for <300ms Interactive Pulse

**Performance Matrix:**
- **Initial Smart-Crop**: <500ms on 10MB images via WebAssembly processing
- **Confidence Updates**: <300ms for UI state changes (no server round-trips)
- **Real-time Sync**: WebSockets for collaborative Brand DNA updates
- **Local Processing**: Images processed in browser RAM/Wasm, only metadata synced to cloud

**Browser Support & Compatibility:**
- **Primary Matrix**: Latest 2 versions of Chrome, Safari, Edge (Chromium), Firefox
- **Mobile Support**: "Review & Approve" mode for iOS/Android (Safari/Chrome)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with Wasm when available

### Implementation Considerations

**SEO Strategy (Minimal):**
- **Landing Page**: MPA-style marketing site with Schema.org markup for "Image Transformation Service"
- **App Architecture**: SPA behind login, minimal SEO requirements for productivity tool
- **Search Intent**: Capture high-intent "professional batch resizing" traffic

**Accessibility Requirements (WCAG 2.1 Level AA):**
